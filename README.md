<h1>Listener</h1>
<div>
<p>The porpouse of Listener is to memorize a list of products and to add them to a shooping list that can be modified by the user with a simple UI.</p>
<p>This is my first published app. I wrote the whole application using kotlin and xml in android studio. Here is the list of the structure of my project:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Room database of products</li>
    <li>custom recycler view with redesigned adapter</li>
    <li>single main activity without the fragment</li>
    <li>FAB speed dial using extern library</li>
    <li>two custom bottom sheets to add products and list's objects</li>
  </ul>
</div>
